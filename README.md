# CloudFlare hook for `dehydrated`

This is a hook for the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ACME client [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) (previously known as `letsencrypt.sh`) that allows you to use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) DNS records to respond to `dns-01` challenges. Requires Python and your CloudFlare account e-mail and API key being in the environment.

## Installation

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
$ cd dehydrated
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/kappataumu/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook hooks/cloudflare
```

If you are using Python 3:
```
$ pip install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, if you are using Python 2 (make sure to also check the [urllib3 documentation](http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#installing-urllib3-with-sni-support-and-certificates) for possible caveats):

```
$ pip install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements-python-2.txt
```


## Configuration

Your account's CloudFlare email and API key are expected to be in the environment, so make sure to:

```
$ export CF_EMAIL='user@example.com'
$ export CF_KEY='K9uX2HyUjeWg5AhAb'
```

Optionally, you can specify the DNS servers to be used for propagation checking via the `CF_DNS_SERVERS` environment variable (props [bennettp123](https://github.com/bennettp123)):

```
$ export CF_DNS_SERVERS='8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4'
```

If you experience problems with DNS propagation, increasing the time (in seconds) this hooks waits for things to settle down after setting the DNS records, may help. The default is 10.

```
$ export CF_SETTLE_TIME='30'
```

If you want more information about what is going on while the hook is running:

```
$ export CF_DEBUG='true'
```

Alternatively, these statements can be placed in `dehydrated/config`, which is automatically sourced by `dehydrated` on startup:

```
echo "export CF_EMAIL=user@example.com" >> config
echo "export CF_KEY=K9uX2HyUjeWg5AhAb" >> config
echo "export CF_DEBUG=true" >> config
```




## Usage

```
$ ./dehydrated -c -d example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'
